- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Alhamzahalabboodi, a passionate, resilient, diligent and an energetic individual with 6 years of work experience in the world of data and analytics. Analyzing data from a business and a technical perspective, identifying anomalies and trends , transforming data (ETL/ ELT ) into a meaningful story that is self explanatory through my front end reports is what I enjoy working on the most. Having said that, I believe that learning is a continuous process and am always keen on learning more.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Engineering and Data Analytics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning, not sure where to start here... Mainly because I wake up everyday with a plan to learn something new. I am currently working on completing the IBM Data Engineering Certificate. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
